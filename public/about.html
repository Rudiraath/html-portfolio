<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a hard working individual. I have had some time studying web dev now. It is one of the best things i have done so far.</p>

<p>I have some hobbies such as aquariums where i actually keep and care for fish and crustacians. I ave also been working on my own line of opening up my own fish shop just to take the hobby to the next level. I also enjoy a good time of stock and forex training as a side hustle.</p>
